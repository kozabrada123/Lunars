# Lunars
Lunars (Lunaro-scores) is a community-made ranking system for Lunaro, a minigame in Digital Extremes' Warframe


## Functionality: 

Lunars is an adapted [elo system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system), in which each player is assigned an elo value determining their skill level.
Depending on players' performances we then lower or raise this elo value.

<br/>

In our rating system players are assigned ranks / titles based on which elo group they are in.
<br/>
These ranks / titles are:
<br/>

2750   +          Champion Candidate
<br/>
2500   –  2750    Master
<br/>
2250   –  2500    Pro
<br/>
2000   –  2250    Skilled
<br/>
1750   –  2000    Amateur
<br/>
1500   –  1750    Padawan
<br/>
1000   –  1500    Neophyte
<br/>


<br/>
